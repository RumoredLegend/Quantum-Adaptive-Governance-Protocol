This project presents a quantum governance protocol executed on IBMâ€™s superconducting QPUs
It models adaptive control through entanglement-weighted elections, veto quorum logic, feedback healing, and multi-mesh arbitration. 
The system maintained collapse symmetry, validating a scalable framework for entangled decision-making and quantum constitutional behavior.
