# Quantum-Adaptive-Governance-Protocol
A 133-qubit quantum governance protocol executed on IBM QPU with 4096 shots. It models entanglement-weighted elections, veto logic, feedback healing, and multi-mesh arbitration. Results show collapse symmetry, suggesting quantum systems can self-organize and adapt under stress.
