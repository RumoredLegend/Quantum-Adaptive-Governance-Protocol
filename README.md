# The Rumored: Quantum Adaptive Governance Protocol – Infinity

**Author**: 
Quantum Systems Architect | Collapse Strategist | Protocol Inventor

Welcome to my repository.  
This project presents a 133-qubit quantum governance protocol executed on IBM’s superconducting QPU with 4096 shots.  
It models adaptive control through entanglement-weighted elections, veto quorum logic, feedback healing, and multi-mesh arbitration.  
The system maintained collapse symmetry, validating a scalable framework for entangled decision-making and quantum constitutional behavior.

## Files
- `QAGP_Infinity.qasm`: Full OPENQASM 2.0 script  
- `collapse_histogram.png`: IBM QPU output  
- `collapse_summary.md`: Tactical analysis of collapse behavior  
- `tactical_layers.md`: Detailed breakdown of each governance concept  
- `deployment_notes.md`: Backend, runtime, and scaling notes

## How to Run
Load the QASM file into IBM Quantum Composer, run with 4096 shots, and analyze the histogram for collapse symmetry and override behavior.

## Scalability Statement:
While this protocol was validated on a 133-qubit mesh, its architecture is fully modular and designed to scale. 
Each tactical layer—entanglement-weighted elections, veto quorum logic, feedback healing, and multi-mesh arbitration—can be extended independently across larger quantum systems. 
Leadership handoff via SWAP chains and bridge arbitration logic support expansion to hundreds or even thousands of qubits, enabling deployment across federated quantum networks or distributed QPU clusters. 
The protocol’s collapse behavior remains governed and resilient under increased complexity, making it suitable for future applications in quantum AI coordination, secure multi-agent systems, and adaptive quantum infrastructure.
