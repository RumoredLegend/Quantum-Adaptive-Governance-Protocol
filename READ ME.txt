Quantum Adaptive Governance Protocol

**Author**: Matthew Rios  
Quantum Systems Architect

## Overview
A 133-qubit quantum governance protocol executed on IBM QPU with 4096 shots.  
It models adaptive control through elections, veto logic, healing, and arbitration.  
Collapse symmetry was achieved, validating a scalable framework for entangled decision-making and quantum constitutional behavior.

## Files
- `QAGP_Infinity.qasm`: Full OPENQASM 2.0 script  
- `collapse_histogram.png`: IBM QPU output  
- `collapse_summary.md`: Tactical analysis of collapse behavior  
- `tactical_layers.md`: Detailed breakdown of each governance concept  
- `deployment_notes.md`: Backend, runtime, and scaling notes

## How to Run
Load the QASM file into IBM Quantum Composer, run with 4096 shots, and analyze the histogram for collapse symmetry and override behavior.
