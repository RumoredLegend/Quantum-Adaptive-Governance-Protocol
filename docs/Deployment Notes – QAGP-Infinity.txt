Deployment Notes – QAGP-Infinity Author: Matthew Rios Protocol: Quantum Adaptive Governance Protocol – Infinity Platform: IBM Quantum Composer | Superconducting QPU Execution Date: August 2025 Shots: 4096 Qubits Used: 133

Backend Details • IBM Backend Used: ibm_torino • QPU Type: Superconducting • Topology: Heavy-hex lattice • Calibration Status: Stable at time of execution • Noise Profile: Low decoherence, minimal readout error across key qubits

Execution Parameters • Total Shots: 4096 • Runtime Duration: ~3 minutes • Measurement Strategy: Full-register collapse • Gate Depth: Moderate, optimized for entanglement propagation and veto logic • Error Mitigation: Native backend calibration only (no post-processing)

Observations • Collapse histogram showed uniform symmetry across all 133 qubits • No dominant bitstrings or collapse bias detected • Veto logic triggered selectively and only under quorum conditions • Feedback healing zones showed reduced entropy post-collapse • Bridge qubits exhibited arbitration behavior between subnet clusters • No anomalies, decoherence spikes, or measurement failures observed

Scalability Notes • Protocol is modular and designed to scale beyond 133 qubits • Tactical layers (elections, veto, healing, arbitration, handoff) operate independently • SWAP chains and bridge logic support expansion to 433+ qubits or federated QPU clusters • Future deployments may integrate dynamic rewiring based on live measurement feedback • Recommended: test on or for higher qubit counts and deeper entanglement

Reproducibility To replicate this deployment:

Load into IBM Quantum Composer
Select backend or equivalent
Set shots to 4096
Run full-register measurement
Analyze histogram for collapse symmetry, override fidelity, and healing behavior
Future Directions • Integrate real-time feedback loops using conditional gate logic • Expand bridge arbitration to multi-layer mesh networks • Test protocol under noisy conditions to validate resilience • Explore hybrid deployment across multiple QPUs using entanglement routing • Apply governance logic to quantum AI agent coordination and secure voting systems

Conclusion: QAGP-Infinity was successfully deployed on IBM hardware with full tactical integrity. The system demonstrated governed collapse behavior, override fidelity, and healing resilience—validating its potential as a scalable framework for quantum constitutional control.
