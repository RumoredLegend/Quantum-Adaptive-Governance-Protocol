Entanglement-Weighted Elections Purpose: Distribute influence across agents based on entanglement depth. Mechanism: • Voter qubits entangle with candidate qubits via CX chains. • Influence is proportional to entanglement reach and coherence.
Pseudocode Logic: // Election: Voter q[0] entangles with candidates q[10–20] h q[0]; cx q[0], q[10]; cx q[0], q[11]; ... cx q[0], q[20];

Outcome: Influence is distributed across the mesh, enabling decentralized leadership selection.

Veto Quorum Logic Purpose: Prevent rogue collapse or override unstable decisions. Mechanism: • Veto requires quorum (e.g. 3 agents) to activate. • Implemented via CCX (Toffoli) gates.
Pseudocode Logic: // Veto: If q[63], q[64], and q[65] agree, override q[30] ccx q[63], q[64], q[30]; ccx q[64], q[65], q[30];

Outcome: Overrides only occur when quorum is met, ensuring constitutional integrity.

Feedback Healing Purpose: Re-entangle fragmented zones after collapse. Mechanism: • Post-measurement CX gates rebind damaged regions. • Healing triggered by collapse outcomes.
Pseudocode Logic: // Healing: Re-entangle q[72–77] based on collapse measure q[70] -> c[0]; cx q[70], q[72]; cx q[70], q[73]; ... cx q[70], q[77];

Outcome: The system self-repairs, restoring coherence and preventing fragmentation.

Collapse-Triggered Rewiring Purpose: Adapt gate logic based on measurement outcomes. Mechanism: • Measurement results dynamically shape future entanglement paths. • Enables responsive governance.
Pseudocode Logic: // Rewire: If q[80] collapses to 1, reconfigure entanglement measure q[80] -> c[1]; if (c[1] == 1) { cx q[80], q[85]; cx q[80], q[86]; }

Outcome: The protocol evolves in response to collapse, maintaining adaptive control.

Multi-Mesh Arbitration Purpose: Coordinate decisions across subnet clusters. Mechanism: • Bridge qubits entangle across meshes. • Arbitration logic negotiates influence and resolves conflicts.
Pseudocode Logic: // Arbitration: Bridge q[99–104] connect Mesh A and Mesh B cx q[99], q[110]; cx q[100], q[111]; ... cx q[104], q[114];

Outcome: Subsystems negotiate rather than isolate, enabling scalable governance.

Leadership Handoff Purpose: Rotate control across agents to prevent concentration. Mechanism:
SWAP chains rotate leadership roles.
Ensures dynamic, fair distribution of authority.
Pseudocode Logic: // Handoff: Rotate leadership across q[120–125] swap q[120], q[121]; swap q[121], q[122]; ... swap q[124], q[125];

Outcome: Leadership is fluid and decentralized, reinforcing constitutional balance

Each tactical layer operates independently yet coherently, forming a modular governance system that scales across entangled agents. Together, they enable quantum systems to elect, veto, heal, rewire, negotiate, and rotate leadership—validating the concept of quantum constitutional behavior.
